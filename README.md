FASTA Handler
=============

The FASTA_Handler class is written as a simple, lightweight interface for
parsing FASTA formatted files into a usable format, for use in solving the
Rosalind problems or any other applications of the file format.

It includes functionality for storing sequences as arrays or strings, for
storing sequence labels, and for dumping sequence content in a readable
format for debugging.
