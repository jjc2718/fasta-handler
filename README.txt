The FASTA_Handler class is written as a black box for parsing FASTA formatted
files into a usable format in PHP, for use in solving the Rosalind problems
or anything else.

It includes functionality for storing sequences as arrays or strings, for
storing sequence labels, and for dumping sequence content in a readable
format for debugging.

More to come as I need/think of it.
